# "Contact the Nearest Doctor" Application
This is a readme file for the "Contact the Nearest Doctor" application built by our team during our first hackathon experience. Our application helps users find and contact nearby doctors to solve their health issues.

## Technologies Used
During the development of this application, our team had the opportunity to learn and work with several technologies, including:

1.Wix: We used Wix website builder to create the frontend of the application. It was an enjoyable experience working with Wix to develop the UI.

2.Django Framework: We used Django, a Python web framework, to build the backend of the application. We gained experience with Django's robust features, including its ORM, views, and templates.

3.Web Design: Our team developed skills in making websites look more aesthetic and appealing by incorporating design elements such as color schemes, typography, and layout.

4.Team Management: As the team leader, I learned how to delegate tasks effectively and manage team members to achieve our goals efficiently.

5.Dedication: We were impressed by the dedication and enthusiasm of the participants in the hackathon.

## Conclusion
Although we didn't win the hackathon, we gained valuable experience and knowledge in various technologies. We believe that our application has the potential to solve real-world problems and can be further developed in the future.
